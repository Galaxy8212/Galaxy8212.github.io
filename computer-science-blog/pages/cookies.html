<h1>Cookies</h1>
<p>
	Cookies are not, unfortunately, the treats made of dough. They are, in fact, small text files, usually one-line long, which store relevant information about websites visited by a computer. This might include a selected language, or ad preferences. Some websites even use cookies to store passwords that are set to ‘remember’. Thus cookies need a lot of security and the id of each one must be unfathomably difficult to find without permission so that hackers cannot find someone’s cookie. Cookies are stored on the computer, as opposed to the website. Whenever you visit a browser, the browser accesses the relevant cookie and 	your information is there. Also, whenever a website uses cookies, they must announce the fact and give an option to refuse them, for data privacy/security reasons.
