<h2>HTML</h2>
<p>
    Hypertext Markup Language is the standard language used by browsers to display webpages.
    HTML was invented by Tim Berners-Lee in 1990, and uses tags. This means that in order to define
    an element (something like a heading or paragraph), you use a <i>tag</i> - such as <code>&lt;p&gt;</code>,
    which displays a simple paragraph. Most tags must be closed with closing tags - like <code>&lt;/p&gt;</code>,
    however some elements, like those for images (<code>&lt;img&gt;</code>) and linking external resources
    (<code>&lt;link&gt;</code>) are auto closing: they donâ€™t need a closing tag. For example, an image is defined as follows:
    <br>
    <code>&lt;img src="image_source_url"&gt;</code>
    <br>
    HTML is closely linked with CSS and JavaScript; a comment in HTML is started with
    <code>&lt;!--</code> and ended with <code>--&gt;</code>.
