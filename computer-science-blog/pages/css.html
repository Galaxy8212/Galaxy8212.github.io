<h2>CSS</h2>
<p>
    Cascading Stylesheets (CSS) are used to style websites - i.e. to make them look pretty.
    Whereas a page without CSS is just displayed as plain content:
    <br>
    <img class="presentation-image" src="images/without_css.jpg">
    <br>
    One with CSS looks a lot more presentable:
    <br>
    <img class="presentation-image" src="images/with_css.jpg">
    <br>
    CSS declarations use the <i>tag names</i> (e.g. <code>p</code>), <i>classes</i> and IDs of
    the elements on the page in order to style them. IDs are written with a preceding hashtag,
    classes are written with a preceding full stop and tag names are written without any preceding characters.
    The styles themselves (like <code>height</code>) should all end in semicolons.
    Here are some example declarations:
    <br>
    <code>
        p {<br>
            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;font-size: 3rem;<br>
        }<br>
        .class_name {<br>
            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;height: 200px;<br>
        }<br>
        #id_name {<br>
            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;font-family: 'Roboto'<br>
        }<br>
    </code>
    <br>
    A comment in CSS is started with <code>/*</code> and ended with <code>*/</code>.
