		<h1>HTTP</h1>
		HTTP is Hypertext Transfer (or Transport) Protocol, the underlying data transfer protocol used on the World Wide Web. It defines what actions web servers and browsers should take in response to commands. For example, when a URL is opened or hyperlink (which is a URL) clicked, your web browser actually sends an HTTP request to the server which hosts the website you're trying to access, in order to fetch it and display it on your screen. Obviously, for each web server to understand these requests, the server and request must both follow this protocol.
