<h2>JavaScript</h2>
<p>
    JavaScript (JS) is a high-level, client-side language, meaning that it is like a human language
    (rather than, for example, binary) and runs on the end user's computer. It is used for many purposes,
    including editing content on a webpage, performing mathematical operations and storing variables.
    Each line of JavaScript should end in a semicolon, for example:
    <br>
    <code>
        // this code sets the content of the element with the ID "id_name" to "Hello World!"<br>
        document.getElementById("id_name").innerHTML = "Hello World!";
    </code>
    <br>
    A single line comment in JS is denoted by a double forward slash (<code>//</code>); a multi line comment
    is started with <code>/*</code> and ended with <code>*/</code>.
