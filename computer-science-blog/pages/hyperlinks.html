		<h1>Hyperlinks</h1>
		A hyperlink is simply a link on the web to some other resource. It uses a special kind of command that jumps you to some other content in your web browser, usually to another page.Â 
		The way to tell if something is a hyperlink is by seeing if your mouse becomes a pointing hand when hovering over it. It is also usually either displayed as blue underlined text or an image/advert. However, the appearance does not change the function.
		Some website owners wish to reserve the right to not be hyperlinked without permission.
		Creating a hyperlink in html:
		<code>&lt;a href="LINK GOES HERE"&gt;TEXT GOES HERE&lt;/a&gt;</code>
