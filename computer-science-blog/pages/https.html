		<h1>HTTPS</h1>
		HTTPS is the secure hypertext transfer protocol, which means that it is a variation on the HTTP protocol - except it uses a secure socket layer (SSL), which is an encryption protocol invoked by an HTTPS request. SSL is essentially the usage of ‘digital passports’, and it functions by ‘hopping onto’ TCP protocols. It does not resend ‘lost’ packets or ‘miscommunicated' data, because this increases security.
