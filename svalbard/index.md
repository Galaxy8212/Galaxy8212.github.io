# Svalbard, Norway
## Background
* Northernmost territory in the world
* 60% glaciers
* 40% tundra
* 5 main islands (largest is Spitzbergen)
* Population of 2700
* More snowmobiles than people

## Opportunities
* Coal mining
    * 300 jobs in coal mines
    * Backbone of economy
* Energy devlopment
    * Located near Mid-Atlantic Ridge - thin & hot rocks
    * Potential for geothermal energy to replace polluting coal power station
    * Or replace water in power station with CO<sub>2</sub>
* Fishing
    * Barents Sea (South of Svalbard) is one of the richest fishing grounds in the world
    * 150 species of fish - conservation is vital
* Tourism
    * 70,000 people visited Longyearbyen in 2011
    * Port was expanded to cope with tourist numbers
    * 300 jobs in tourism
    * Northen lights, natural environment and adventures attract tourists

## Challenges
* Extreme temperatures
    * Sometimes below -30&deg;C
    * But wear warm clothes
* Construction
    * Permafrost has to be protected from melting before foundations can be dug
    * Difficult to build in the cold and the long dark periods - so most work is done in the summer
    * However, road maintenance is relatively easy
* Services
    * Pipes and cables must be kept off the ground, to ensure they don't freeze
* Accessibility
    * Limited transport
    * Islands can only be accessed by plane or ship
    * Only 50 km of roads in Longyearbyen
    * But there is an international airport
    * And snowmobiles can be used to travel around
