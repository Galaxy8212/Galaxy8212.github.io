Hi!

My name is Galaxy, I live in the UK and I love Minecraft.

I've been playing Java for over 6 years and bedrock for over 8! I'm decent at redstone, however, I first started learning on bedrock, and am still discovering new things now. I'd also really like to learn about more complex commands, in the hope that I could someday create my own adventure map.

I'm currently still at school, so wont be able to upload videos more than once (maybe twice) a week, so I'm hoping to upload a video every Sunday, and maybe on a Thursday as well if you're lucky! If you have any suggestions of things you'd like me to do, post them on the discussions tab on my YouTube account and I'll take a look.
